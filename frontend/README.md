# Frontend for Social_Media

This folder contains the client-side code for the social media application, built using React.

## Frontend Technologies
The frontend of the application is built using the following technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components.
- **Redux**: A state management library that helps manage the application state in a predictable way, making it easier to debug and test.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different pages without reloading the entire app.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend APIs, facilitating data fetching and submission.

## Features
